# DevOps Maturity Assessment

## Overview

This is a simple, survey-based tool, to help teams assess where they currently are on their Digital journey and to help them identify next steps for further improvement.

## Installation

This is a PHP application that should run on any server that supports PHP 5.5 or higher with Mod_Rewrite enabled. We have also provided an [app.yaml](https://github.com/atosorigin/DevOpsMaturityAssessment/blob/master/app.yaml) for deployment into [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).

## How to Contribute

Fork us and submit a pull request! If you are updating [questions.json](https://github.com/atosorigin/DevOpsMaturityAssessment/blob/master/questions.json) or [advice.json](https://github.com/atosorigin/DevOpsMaturityAssessment/blob/master/advice.json), please check that it passes a JSON validator (such as [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/)).

If you would like to adjust colours/branding for your own purpose, please do this in a separate branch. For example, we maintain the atos-colours branch, but changes to the main code are always merged into atos-colours from master.

## Technical Overview

* Survey questions are configured in [questions.json](https://github.com/atosorigin/DevOpsMaturityAssessment/blob/master/questions.json)
* When a user first accesses the survey, all the questions are loaded into session storage
* As the user completes the survey, their responses are saved in session storage
* Loading questions, processing responses, and generating summary results is all managed by the Survey class defined in [survey.php](https://github.com/atosorigin/DevOpsMaturityAssessment/blob/master/survey.php)
* Rendering of the survey is performed by [collectResponses.php](https://github.com/atosorigin/DevOpsMaturityAssessment/blob/master/collectResponses.php)
* Rendering of the survey results is performed by [viewResults.php](https://github.com/atosorigin/DevOpsMaturityAssessment/blob/master/viewResults.php)
* Layout uses customised [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 4.1.3
* Rendering charts uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) 2.7.2
* Icons from [Font Awesome Free](https://fontawesome.com/free) 5.3.1
